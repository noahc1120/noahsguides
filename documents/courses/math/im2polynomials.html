                <h2>Polynomials Introduction</h2>
                <p> 
                    Polynomials are algebraic expressions with more than two terms.<br><br>
                    The word <i>poly</i> comes from the Greek word <span class="greek">polu</span>
                    meaning <b>much</b> or <b>many</b>. The word <i>nomial</i> means a <b>name</b> or <b>term</b>. 
                    Hence, <b><i>polynomials</i></b> = <i>many terms!</i>
                </p>
                <h3>Polynomial Terminology & Parts</h3>
                <p>
                    Polynomials are multi-term algebraic expressions and consist of the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Constants</b> - Non-variable values, like 21, -9, Pi, etc</li>
                    <li><b>Variables</b> - Varying values, like <i>x, y, z, a, b,</i> etc</li>
                    <li><b>Exponents</b> - Superscript numbers that can multiply a term by itself however many times, like x<sup>2</sup> or 3y<sup>5</sup></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These parts can be combined to form the algebraic expression through any basic arithmetic operation 
                    except when a term is being divided by a variable or has a negative exponent.<br><br>
                    The format of a term is as follows: <span class="mathStyles">ax<sup>k</sup></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>x</i> reprsenting the variable,
                    <i>a</i> being the coeffecient of the variable, and <i>k</i> being the exponent or <em>degree</em> of the term.<br><br>
                    If that's the general format of a term in a polynomial, well how do constants fit in you may ask? It's actually quite straightforward.
                    A constant is represented as <span class="mathStyles">(1 Ã— #)<sup>1</sup></span>&nbsp;The number is simply multipled by 1 for its coeffecient value and raised to the power of 1.
                </p>
                <div class="mathTip">
                    Quick reminder that a <strong>coeffecient</strong> is the integer in front of a variable. It multiples the variable by it's value.
                    If there is no number however, the coeffecient value is 1, thus multiplying whatever variable there is by itself.
                </div>
                <p>
                    The <b>Degree</b> in poylnomials refers to the the largest exponent value present within the terms. <b>Standard Form</b> is the general layout in which
                    terms are written in descending order from the LARGEST exponent value to the SMALLEST exponent value.
                </p>
                <div class="mathTip">
                    Stanard Form Example: <span class="mathStyles">3x<sup>3</sup> - 4x<sup>2</sup> + 2</span>&nbsp;This polynomial is a cubic trionomial. This is because 3 is the largest exponent value and there are 3 terms.
